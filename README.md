## Phases
- **Phase 1:** Environment setup + Figma + SCSS → Portfolio template  
- **Phase 2:** WordPress + CMS integration → Blog template  
- **Phase 3:** Performance audits (Lighthouse, GTmetrix) + cross‑browser testing → E‑commerce page  
- **Phase 4:** Analytics (GA4, GTM, HotJar) → Event landing page  
- **Phase 5:** Accessibility (WCAG, ARIA) + SEO (Core Web Vitals, meta tags) → Non‑profit page  
- **Phase 6:** AI tools (GitHub Copilot, AI checkers) → SaaS marketing page + case study


## Progress  
### Phase 1: Environment & Setup  
- Installed **WSL Ubuntu 24** and migrated GitHub tracking.  
- Initialized a new Git repo and linked the local project folder.  
- Selected the **Next.js stack** (JavaScript, ESLint, React Compiler, SCSS, App Router, `@/` alias).  
- Bootstrapped the project with `npx create-next-app@latest`.  
- **Deliverable:** Clean Next.js boilerplate repository.  

### Phase 1: Styling & Components  
- Leveraged prior CSS experience to transition into **SCSS** (this project uses SCSS exclusively).  
- Installed **Sass** for **SCSS** support. Ran `npm audit`, identified a critical Next.js vulnerability, and upgraded to `next@16.0.7` to resolve it.  
- Created Navigation Bar and Footer component with placeholder links, tested SCSS styling features.  

### Phase 1: Design Workflow  
- Installed **Figma** and began learning design fundamentals.  
- Designed the **global layout** (header, footer, main content) in Figma.  
- Refined designs using Figma Make.  
- Converted Figma Tailwind CSS output into **SCSS**, styled the app using both Figma code generation and GitHub Copilot AI assistance.  

### Phase 1: Routing & Structure  
- Added nav bar links for all planned pages (Portfolio, Blog, E‑Commerce, Event, Non‑Profit, SaaS).  
- Confirmed **routing** works correctly, with each link opening a placeholder component page.  
- Followed best practices for folder naming conventions in the App Router structure.  

- Integrate **WordPress** API by creating WordPress account, publishing website and targeting API endpoint. Use CoPilot to help understand initial code and tested until app is live updating with every WordPress post. (**Blog section** in the app)

- Made a reusable loading-bar component to count down WordPress API refresh interval. (60 seconds)
