## Progress  
### Phase 1: Environment & Setup  
- Installed **WSL Ubuntu 24** and migrated GitHub tracking.  
- Initialized a new Git repo and linked the local project folder.  
- Selected the **Next.js stack** (JavaScript, ESLint, React Compiler, SCSS, App Router, `@/` alias).  
- Bootstrapped the project with `npx create-next-app@latest`.  
- **Deliverable:** Clean Next.js boilerplate repository.  

### Phase 1: Styling & Components  
- Leveraged prior CSS experience to transition into **SCSS** (this project uses SCSS exclusively).  
- Installed **Sass** for **SCSS** support. Ran `npm audit`, identified a critical Next.js vulnerability, and upgraded to `next@16.0.7` to resolve it.  
- Created Navigation Bar and Footer component with placeholder links, tested SCSS styling features.  

### Phase 1: Design Workflow [complete]
- Installed **Figma** and began learning design fundamentals.  
- Designed the **global layout** (header, footer, main content) in Figma.  
- Refined designs using Figma Make.  
- Converted Figma Tailwind CSS output into **SCSS**, styled the app using both Figma code generation and GitHub Copilot AI assistance.  

- Added nav bar links for all planned pages (Portfolio, Blog, E‑Commerce, Event, Non‑Profit, SaaS).  
- Confirmed **routing** works correctly, with each link opening a placeholder component page.  
- Followed best practices for folder naming conventions in the App Router structure.  

### Phase 2: WordPress + CMS Integration [complete]
- Integrate **WordPress** API by creating WordPress account, publishing website and targeting API endpoint. 
- Used CoPilot to help understand initial code and tested until app is live updating with every WordPress post. (**Blog section** in the app)
- Made a reusable loading-bar component to count down WordPress API refresh interval. (60 seconds)

- **Deployed** main branch with Vercel, created a development branch for future work.

### Phase 2.5: Design Layouts
- Portfolio, E-commerce, Blog, Event
- Added default style reset to fix the navigation bar: border-box, body-padding-top:60px, and margin-0.
- Restyled the NavBar using free **animation** buttons for a smoother layout.  
- Added free **Tailwind** styled cards to the WordPress page.  
- Completed the WordPress page design with new animations from **UIVerse**.  
- Converted Tailwind components into **SCSS modules** to align with project standards.  
- Implemented **animated placeholders** across all pages for a dynamic user experience.  

- Added **dynamic wallpapers** for each page.
- Learned to apply wallpaper styling from main layout.js, then load them per page using globals.SCSS.
- Improved animations for each page. 
- **SCSS** styling overhaul for all pages using variables.
- **Responsive Layout** which scales to fit phone screens.
